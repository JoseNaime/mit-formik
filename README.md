# MIT Formik Example
Formik is a small library that can help you with the three most annoying aspects of creating forms in React:

- Getting values in and out of the form state
- Validation and error messages
- Handling form submission

By collecting all of the above in one place, Formik can keep things organized, making testing, refactoring, and reasoning your forms much easier.
